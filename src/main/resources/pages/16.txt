Hello, friend, here is the sixteenth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter, today at least somewhat on time :P
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to this Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The Animals of the Week are the fly, Edward the sea lion, and in 1st place the blue jay!
Blue jays are a common bird species in North America and belong to the corvids, so they are related to ravens, crows and magpies. As their name suggests, they have blue plumage, with many white accents, black wing and tail feather tips and a black collar. The blue jay's crest and black beak make it particularly striking. They grow up to 316 cm long, weigh up to 11616 grams, and are found in almost all eastern and central regions of the USA as well as southern Canada; in winter, the northernmost populations migrate as far south as Texas.
Blue jays feed on fruits, seeds, insects and small mammals. If they find a partner, they live monogamously and stay together for life. What is special about the blue jay is its habit of taking seeds and nuts to other places and burying them in the ground there to eat them later. This behavior has played a major role in enabling some tree species such as oaks and spruces to spread back in North America after the last ice age. This would not have been possible without the seed transport of the blue jays!
These great animals are also, like other corvids, able to imitate other bird species and use tools! Some blue jays have been observed tearing off newspaper and rolling it up to get to food in otherwise inaccessible places. Clever birds! :)
Please feel free to suggest a new animal this week!!!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Stay cool and see you next Monday!
