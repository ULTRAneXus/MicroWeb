Hello, friend, here is the third issue of my weekly friendship newsletter!
I'm glad to hear that you all still like this project! c:
I hope you had a nice weekend, mine was okay.
The Animal of the Week is the hedgehog! They are small, cute, nocturnal, hibernate, are born without their spines, and feed on insects.
Even if your animal wasn't presented this time, tell me which is your Animal of the Week for this new week anyway! :)
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well, and wish you a nice start to the day and the week!
See you next Monday if not earlier! :fox_wave:
