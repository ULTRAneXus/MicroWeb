Hello, friend, here is the ninth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to this Monday!
Tell me about your last week!
The animals of the week are the camel, the antilope and the fr*nch Charolais bull bully!
Feel free to suggest a new animal this week too! :D
And, to celebrate the start of this year's first summer month, tell me your favorite ice cream flavor! ;)
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice start into the new week! Enjoy the weather and stay healthy! Drink enough :)
See you next Monday! (but prolly earlier because friendshp-pilled) :wavekanna:
