Hello, friends!
New semester, new luck, and I want to share some of that with you!
This is my first weekly check-in. I want to be a better friend to all of you, because I don't want to lose anyone from my circle just because we stop writing to each other!
This little message goes to everyone in my circle of friends. You don't have to reply to this (tho I would be very happy if you did)!
If this comes across as a bit strange, well, it might be ðŸ˜† but I've always wanted to do this because I've lost friends in the past due to not texting each other anymore, and I love my amigos!
So, first of all, I hope you are doing well and are healthy and happy, but if not, that's okay too!
I wish you all a good start into the week and you'll hear from me next monday if not earlier :fox_wave:

Edit: I'm an absolute goober and realised i forgor to send out these texts on discord and covered only the other platforms. Well, that's a bit awkward now, but here's the last two weeks as well :blobhypersweat:
