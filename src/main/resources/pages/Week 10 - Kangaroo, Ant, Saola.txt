Hello, friend, here is the tenth!!! issue of my weekly friendship newsletter :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to this Monday!
Tell me about your last week!
10 weeks have now passed since I started this little project, that's almost a fifth of the year!
I am very happy to hear so much positive feedback from you every week! <3
On the occasion of this little anniversary, there will be a slightly longer issue this week. One of the readers of this friendship magazine gave me the idea of also attaching a few facts and pictures to the Animal of the Week; thus i have decided to revise the format a bit. There will still be a Top 3 Animals of the Week, and 1st place will get a few extra facts!
I will test this out this week, so please give me feedback!
The Animals of the Week are the kangaroo, the ant and in 1st place the saola!
The saola is a type of wild cattle and lives in Laos and Vietnam. It is about 90cm tall and 180cm long and weighs up to 100kg, has dark brown fur (except for a white spot above each hoof and a white facial pattern) and horns up to 50cm long. The special thing about saola is that they were only discovered in 1993 and were only rediscovered in the wild in 2013. They are very shy and there are probably only a few hundred animals of their kind left, but thanks to new conservation areas in Vietnam, their survival seems to be secured for the time being!
Feel free to suggest a new animal this week too. Searching for these facts is really fun! :D
And, last but not least, here are the results of last week's ice cream survey:
Among the 23 respondents, the most popular flavor with 5 votes was Cookies, but Vanilla and Chocolate Mint were also popular.
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! See you next Monday at the latest!
