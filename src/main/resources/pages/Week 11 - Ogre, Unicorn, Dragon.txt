Hello, friend, here is the eleventh issue of my weekly friendship newsletter :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to this Monday!
Tell me about your week!
11 weeks is a nice number, so I decided that all of these lucky numbers' weeks, i will turn of the Animals of the Week into the mythical creatures of the Week! Submissions of mythical beings from all of you are also welcome! I also accept creatures that can be of human nature and not just pure animal beings.
The mythical creatures of this week are the ogre, the unicorn, and in 1st place the dragon!
Dragons are probably the most famous fantasy creatures of all, known for their size, power and love of golden treasures. In many stories they possess human intelligence (and also greed and cruelty), can speak, breathe fire and fly. Unlike wyverns, dragons have 4 legs, with the front two also being their wings. They are armored with scales and can live to be very old. Dragons are often described as giant creatures, larger than a house, even as large as a mountain in some stories, but they also come in small, friendly versions. I'll name a few, maybe you recognize all of them: Smaug, Toothless, Tabaluga, Balerion.
Feel free to suggest a new animal or magical creature this week too!
And, optionally for those interested in football, give me your tip for the European Championship winner!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! See you next Monday at the latest!
