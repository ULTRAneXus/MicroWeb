Hello, friend, here is the twelfth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The warmest week of the year so far is starting, so remember to drink enough!
The Animals of the Week are the penguin, the capon, and in 1st place the olm!
Olms belong to the tailed amphibians and are only found in caves in the Balkans. There they live in mostly complete darkness, are therefore also blind with overgrown eyes, and spend most of their time underwater. Unlike other amphibians, they do not go through metamorphosis and therefore remain a kind of larva for their entire lives, but are still fully grown animals - almost like puppies that never become adult dogs. Relatives of the olms, which live in North America, are therefore also called mud puppies! Olms grow to about 30cm tall and can live up to 100 years! Scientists have not yet been able to find out how the little newts can get so old, which is why they could be of great medical importance. Olms have both lungs and gills, so they can breathe on land and underwater, but their lungs are very weak, which is why they mainly live in streams or ponds in caves. They feed on small fish and insects. Olms have been around for over 20 million years, a fossil species! Unfortunately, the animals are now threatened with extinction due to poaching and pollution, but new conservation areas are helping the remaining populations to survive. I find them very cute! :)
Feel free to suggest a new animal or magical creature this week too! (I'm running out of animals, so hop hop)
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Stay cool and see you next Monday!
