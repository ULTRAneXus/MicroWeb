Hello, friend, here is the thirteenth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter, this time as an evening edition ;)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The Animals of the Week are the trout, the ant and in 1st place the red fox!
Foxes are great! Here in Europe, the red fox lives, but it has many relatives such as the fennek in the desert or the polar fox in Siberia. Foxes belong to the dog family and are partly directly related to them, as is our red fox. They got their name from the Old High German "Vuhs". Red foxes have orange-red fur with a white underbelly and black legs, but they sometimes also come in the silver fox version with darker, almost black fur. They are slightly larger than cats and can weigh up to 10 kg. Foxes are omnivores and feed on small animals, insects and fruits, sometimes they even bury their food as a hiding place. Similar to other dogs, they can live up to 14 years in captivity, but in the wild they rarely get only half as old. They live in complex social structures in sometimes large families with different hierarchies. If possible, fox couples stay together for a lifetime, but under certain circumstances they can also have constantly changing partners. When they are not looking for food, they spend most of their time in self-dug burrows underground, where they raise their young, but sometimes even live peacefully with other animal species such as martens or rabbits. And on top of that, they're so cute! :) Feel free to suggest a new animal this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Stay cool and see you next Monday!
