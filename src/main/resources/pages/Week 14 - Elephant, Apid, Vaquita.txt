Hello, friend, here is the fourteenth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter, today again as an evening edition ^^'7
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The Animals of the Week are the elephant, the aphid and in 1st place the vaquita!
The Californian vaquita is a small whale that lives in the Gulf of California. Compared to their other relatives, they are tiny; only about 1.50m big and up to 50kg heavy, while a blue whale easily weighs over 100 tons. They are grey in color, their fins and back are slightly darker, and they have black borders around their eyes and mouth. They feed on native fish such as the jack mackerel and the sculpin (great names, right?), crustaceans and smaller squid. They live to be up to 20 years old and mostly live in pairs (after the mating season with their calf), rarely in groups of up to 10 animals, where there are more females than males. Now it gets a bit sad, but I felt it was important to mention. The vaquitas are among the 100 animals that are most threatened with extinction. In 1990 they were already classified as endangered, at that time there were still over 1000 animals. Today there are said to be only about 30 specimens left... The blame lies with local fishing, as the vaquitas die as "bycatch" in fishing nets. Politics and business refuse to take protective measures, which is why this species will probably completely die out in a few years. I'm sorry for the gloomy Animal of the Week, next time I'll take something more cheerful, but I wanted to put the spotlight on the extinction of species caused by human hands.
Feel free to suggest a new animal this week!!!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Stay cool and see you next Monday!
