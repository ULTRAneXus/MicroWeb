Hello, friend, here is the seventeenth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday! Tell me about your week sometime!
The Animals of the Week are the mosquito, the blue-necked ostrich, and in 1st place the lungfish!
The lungfish is - as the name suggests, a fish that breathes air instead of water! They are widespread in Africa, Australia, and South America, where they live in still waters, and grow up to 2 meters long! They are very sluggish fish and feed on mussels, crayfish, and other bottom-dwelling water animals. Although they have gills, lungfish must come to the water surface to breathe air every 30-60 minutes, otherwise they will suffocate. Their gills serve only to release CO2. Lungfish can survive droughts by burrowing into the ground, surrounding their bodies with a secretion, and feeding on their muscle tissue until there is water and thus food in their environment again. And they have been doing this for over 300 million years! The lungfish species developed in the Devonian period and is thus older than the dinosaurs! And not only that, the lungfish also has the most complex DNA of all living things, no animal or plant has more genomes. Oh, and its lung is not in the upper body as in humans, but lies on its intestine. Strange animals... Together with the coelacanth (with which they are also closely related) truly living fossils!
Suggest a new animal for this week too!!!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Stay cool and see you next Monday!
