Hello, friend, here is the eighteenth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The Animals of the Week are the gnu, the penguin, and in 1st place the peregrine falcon!
Peregrine falcons are among the largest falcons in the world. They grow up to 50 cm long with a wingspan of 110 cm, with males being significantly smaller. They are the most widespread bird species in the world and live on all continents except Antarctica! They are cliff nesters, which means they do not build their own nests but breed in rock crevices, tree cavities, or in the nests of other bird species. In human environments, they prefer to live on chimneys, large towers, and even bucket-wheel excavators! They can live up to 15 years and feed on smaller birds such as pigeons, young gulls, thrushes, and larks. The peregrine falcon hunts its prey exclusively in the air, either attacking from behind or from above in a dive. In doing so, they can reach speeds of up to 380 km/h, making them the fastest living creature! In freefall, they fold their feet together and thus kill their prey on impact. Peregrine falcons often hunt in pairs, making them very effective hunters. In the 1950s, peregrine falcons in Europe and North America became almost extinct. The cause was a new pesticide in agriculture, which as a side effect thinned the eggshells of many bird species and thus killed the eggs. But as of today, however, they have been able to fully recover their populations and the peregrine falcon is not considered endangered! :D
Suggest a new animal for this week too!!!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Stay cool and see you next Monday at the latest!
