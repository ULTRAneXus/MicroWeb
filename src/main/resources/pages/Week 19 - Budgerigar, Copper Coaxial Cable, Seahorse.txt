Hello, friend, here is the nineteenth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The Animals of the Week are the budgerigar, the copper coaxial cable, and in 1st place the seahorse!
The little horse fish with a curly tail! Seahorses belong to the bony fishes in the family of syngnathids, which also includes pipefishes and sea dragons. Seahorses can grow from 2cm to 35cm depending on the subspecies and live widely in tropical and warm-temperate, salty waters. Thus, they can be found in waters around Asia, Australia, Africa and Europe, as well as the Americas. Seahorses live in small territories, usually where seagrass also grows. While males rarely leave their home, females often explore their surroundings extensively. Seahorses have the special characteristic that the males carry the brood. They do this like kangaroos in a kind of pouch where the young grow up and are then born alive. But that's not all that makes the seahorse special: it's the slowest fish in the world! At only up to 1.5m per hour, every other fish species is faster than them. Since the males, however, live mainly stationary - and hold on to plants with their tail - this will probably not bother them much. ^^
Suggest a new animal for this week too!!!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Take good care of yourself in this weather and see you next Monday!
