Hello, friend, to my second Weekly check/Friendship newsletter!
After exclusively positive reactions, I'm happy to send you another little message to start the week. To make the whole thing a bit more interactive, I'd like to experiment a bit in the coming weeks; let's start with the Animal of the Week! For this week, I appoint the badger as its german translation "Dachs" rhymes with Max :P
For the next few weeks, you're welcome to suggest one :)
These Weekly checks will probably get longer as a result, but I hope that doesn't bother you (if so, please give me feedback!)
Furthermore, I hope you are all doing well and wish you a nice and as stress-free week as possible! See you next Monday at the latest! :Wavey:
