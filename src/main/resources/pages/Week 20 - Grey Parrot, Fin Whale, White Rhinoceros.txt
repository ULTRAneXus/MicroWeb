Hello, friend, here is the twentieth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! Another milestone! :D
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to this Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The Animals of the Week are the grey parrot, the fin whale, and in 1st place the white rhinoceros!
White rhinoceroses are the second heaviest land mammals in the world after elephants, and are significantly more massive in relation to body size than, for example, giraffes or even elephant seals, the largest seals in the world. White rhinoceroses grow up to 4m long with a shoulder height of 2m, with females being slightly smaller. They live in the savannas of Africa, can live up to 50 years and feed on various grasses. They spend more than half of the day grazing but are not ruminants. The bulls live alone in large territories while the females, with their offspring, have their own territories in small groups, but these intersect with those of the males. Rhinos are famous for their two horns, which are not made of ivory but of keratin - the same material as our hair and fingernails. Nevertheless, they are hunted and poached for their horns. As a result, white rhinoceroses almost became extinct, but the population was able to recover to 20,000 specimens by 2010, unfortunately this number is also declining again as poaching has become profitable again in recent years due to East Asian expansions into the African market. The North African white rhinoceroses are therefore extinct, they only exist in zoos. However, initial rewilding projects were successful, so a comeback of these heavy animals in North Africa is possible! :)
Suggest a new animal for this week too!!! Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
