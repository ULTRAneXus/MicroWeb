Hello, friend, here is the twenty-first issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The Animals of the Week are the harvestman, the gerbillinae, and in 1st place the poison dart frog!
Poison dart frogs, also commonly known as poison frogs, are a family of amphibians that also includes toads and newts. They live exclusively in the South American rainforest because they need the hot and humid climate of the tropics to survive. They can live up to 15 years and can grow to sizes of 1-5cm. As the name suggests, poison dart frogs are poisonous. They secrete neurotoxins through their skin, which can cause seizures and respiratory arrest. Contact with a poisonous poison dart frog can kill an adult human within 20 minutes! In fact, however, only about a third of all poison dart frogs are poisonous, and only 3 species of them (including the golden poison frog and the terrible poison frog) are used by indigenous people for their poison. The hunters' arrowheads are coated with the secretion and thus used for hunting. Nevertheless, all species of poison dart frogs are brightly colored; this is called aposematism, the deterrence of predators by warning colors. Interestingly, the different subspecies have different colorations, but some species mimic the coloration of other (usually more poisonous) species. By the way, poison dart frogs produce their poison through their diet, which consists of mites, ants, and beetles. They can convert the poison from, for example, ants into their own neurotoxin and thus protect themselves from predators! Suggest a new animal for this week too! Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
