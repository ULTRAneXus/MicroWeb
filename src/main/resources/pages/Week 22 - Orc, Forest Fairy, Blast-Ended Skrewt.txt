Hello, friend, here is the twenty-second issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
22, a double number, so it's time again for mythical creatures instead of normal animals this week!
The mythical creatures of the week are the orc, the forest fairy, and in 1st place, the Blast-Ended Skrewt!
Known to every Harry Potter fan: a presumably illegal crossbreed of a Fire Crab and a Manticore (Manticores are creatures with a human head, the body of a lion, and a scorpion's tail). Freshly hatched Blast-Ended Skrewts look like unarmored lobsters, milky white and seemingly headless. As adults, they can grow up to 3 meters long and are heavily armored; almost invulnerable. They have many legs that protrude from various parts of their body and they move by exploding their rear end! They are very aggressive and prefer to eat the flesh of their own kind or humans. Their armor also makes them immune to any kind of magic, they can only be attacked on their vulnerable underside. Compared to the dragons from the last mythical creature edition, they are of course only small beetles, but nevertheless a very deadly danger to humans!
Suggest a new mythical creature for this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday at the latest!
