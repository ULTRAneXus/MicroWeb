Hello, friend, here is the twenty-third issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week!
The animals of the week are the hamster, the Galapagos tortoise, and in 1st place the aardwolf!
The aardwolf is not a wolf, as the name might suggest, it doesn't even belong to the canine family. Aardwolves belong to the feline family (cats), more specifically, they are a kind of hyena. Aardwolves are the smallest of all hyenas and weigh only up to 14kg and are 80cm long, with their tail being another 1/3 of their body length. They are golden brown with black stripes and have a very bushy mane that runs along their entire back and that they can erect. They only occur in East and South Africa in smaller populations but are not an endangered species. Aardwolves have two special characteristics: Firstly, they don't eat carrion or hunt like other hyenas, but feed almost exclusively on termites. With their long, sticky tongues, they can eat up to 300,000 in a day! Sounds like a lot, but considering the size of termites, that's only about 1-2kg. Secondly, aardwolves have a very peculiar social behavior; males and females each live as pairs in their territories, but avoid each other outside of the mating season. During the mating season, males often wander into other territories and reproduce there, but then return and live with the female in their own territory for some time. This can lead to aardwolf males raising young that are not their own! A real father of the year. :P
Suggest a new animal for this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
