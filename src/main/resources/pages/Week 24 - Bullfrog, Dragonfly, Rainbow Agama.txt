Hello, friend, here is the twenty-fourth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the bullfrog, the dragonfly, and in 1st place the rainbow agama!
Rainbow agamas are small lizards and known for their body color, which can change depending on their mood. They live in Central and West Africa, grow up to 30cm long and eat almost anything: insects, spiders, other reptiles and smaller mammals, sometimes even plants. Rainbow agamas, also called settler agamas in german, live, as the name suggests, together in colonies. Up to 25 animals, led by a dominant male, live together and spend most of their time sunning themselves on stones or other places. Male rainbow agamas have either a gray coloration depending on their rank or, as a dominant male, a shimmering blue-turquoise coloration with an orange head. The coloration changes depending on how long they sunbathe during the day. Females are grayish in color and show orange stripes during pregnancy. If the dominant male is challenged by a rival, their heads turn brown and their bodies show white spots. They also hiss at each other and try to hit the opponent with their tail on the head. The winner gets to lead the colony, the loser has to leave. In addition to the hierarchies, rainbow agamas also have fixed feeding places, which vary depending on rank, and the best sunning spots are reserved for the highest-ranking animals. You could draw parallels to human society here. :P
Suggest a new animal for this week too! Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week!
Drink enough and see you next Monday!
