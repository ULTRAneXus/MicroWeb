Hello, friend, here is the twenty-fifth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! A quarter of a century! :D
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime! The animals of the week are the toad, the hippopotamus, and in 1st place the elephant seal!
Elephant seals are the largest seals in the world! They can grow up to 6.5m long and weigh 3.5t, larger than a whole car! Although this only applies to males, the females are only half as big. They come in two versions, in the north on the West American coasts and in the south in the Subantarctic. Elephant seals can live up to 20 years and feed on fish and squid. In search of these, they dive between 200-600m deep, but specimens have also been discovered at a depth of 2400m! On land they have no predators, but in the water they are hunted by white sharks and orcas. Elephant seals are known for their nose, which is large and inflated in bulls. Similar to, for example, proboscis monkeys, they can use it to make sounds, which are particularly noticeable during the mating season. There, the bulls fight for dominance over the females. The winner and leader of the harem is called "beach-master"! xD
Suggest a new animal for this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
