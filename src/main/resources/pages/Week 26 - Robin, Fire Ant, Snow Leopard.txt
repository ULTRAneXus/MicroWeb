Hello, friend, this is the twenty-sixth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! Today is the half-year anniversary! :D
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the robin, the fire ant, and in 1st place the snow leopard!
Snow leopards are the smaller version of leopards and live in the mountains of the Himalayas and the northern surroundings up to Siberia. They can live up to 20 years and grow up to 130cm long, with their bushy tail being almost as long. They can weigh up to 75kg and feed mainly on sheep, other ungulates, marmots and some plants. Snow leopards live in mountains, mountain meadows and light coniferous forests, usually at altitudes between 2000m and 6000m. They have a very dense, white-gray fur with black rings and a white underbelly. Their long tail has a thick layer of fat, which serves as a warming function like a blanket when sleeping. When hunting and maneuvering through the mountains, it serves as a balancing rudder. Snow leopards have short snouts with large nostrils, so they can warm the cold outside air for the lungs and breathe the oxygen-poor high-altitude air better. Their paws are very bushy and wide, allowing them to walk on snow without sinking in much. Their only natural predators are wolves and bears, but unfortunately, humans also pose a serious threat. Thanks to decades of poaching, snow leopards are considered endangered, especially the decline of natural prey is a problem for them. Fun fact: snow leopards are most closely related to lions!
Suggest a new animal for this week too! Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
