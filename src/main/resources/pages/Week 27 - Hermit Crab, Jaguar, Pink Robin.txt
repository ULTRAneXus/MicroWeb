Hello, friend, here is the twenty-seventh issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! Evening edition today ;)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to this Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the hermit crab, the jaguar, and in 1st place the pink robin!
The pink robin is a songbird native to Australia. They grow up to 13cm and weigh a hefty 11 grams. As the name suggests, they have a striking pink-magenta plumage, while the wing and tail feathers are grayish-brown (varying by sex) and the head feathers are black. They feed on insects and build very special nests, which are shaped like a bowl about 2m high and made of grasses, moss and animal hair, woven together with spider webs. They are a widespread species in Australia and are considered not endangered! :D
Suggest a new animal for this week too!
For me, the new semester at university started today, for many of my readers (maybe you too?) as well! Tell me what you have planned for this month! :)
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next monday!
