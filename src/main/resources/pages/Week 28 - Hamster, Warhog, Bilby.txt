Hello, friend, here is the twenty-eighth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter!
A bit late today :foxbox:
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday! Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the hamster, the warthog, and in 1st place the bilby!
Bilbies are Australian marsupials native to steppes and desert regions. Their Greek name translates to "big ears", and that's fitting, because in addition to their kangaroo-like legs and long snout, the little creatures have large ears, like many small desert dwellers. They grow up to half a meter long and weigh 2.5kg. Their fur is gray-brown with a golden underbelly and white tail tip. They feed on insects, larvae, fungi, and fruits; in search of food, they dig a lot, helped by their strong hind legs and claws. They live in colonies in self-dug tunnels, up to 12 animals in one network. Bilbies used to live all over Australia, but they were displaced from the forested and tropical regions by invasive species such as the cat and the red fox and are now considered endangered.
Suggest a new animal for this week too! Oh, and so I can put it in my calendar, tell me when your birthday is, otherwise I'll forget again ^^'7 Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
