Hello, friend, here is the twenty-ninth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter!
Again a bit late today, and that will probably remain so until the end of my semester. ^^'7
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday! Tell me about your week!
The animals of the week are the mongoose, the sloth, and in 1st place the crabeater seal!
Crabeater seals are a type of seal that lives in Antarctica, together with leopard seals and weddell seals. They grow up to 2.50m long and weigh up to 250kg, making them a rather light species for seals. They can live up to 40 years and are home in the coastal regions of Antarctica, in summer also further north, as far as Tierra del Fuego, New Zealand and South Africa. Crabeater seals feed, as the name suggests, on: that's right, plankton! A large part of which is provided by krill. Their teeth are therefore very unusual for seals, they have small recesses that serve as filters to keep the krill in their mouths. When hunting, the seals rarely dive deeper than 50m, but they can dive up to 500m deep! Every day, crabeater seals spend about 16 hours in the water, then they lie on the Antarctic ice to sleep. A somewhat creepy peculiarity of young crabeater seals is that they sometimes lose their orientation in the ice and can no longer find their way back to the breathing hole from which they normally hunt. The lost young animals often wander deep into the south and starve there. In fact, you can find many frozen seal carcasses in Antarctica. Spooky. In addition, they have to fear orcas and leopard seals as their predators. The mating and breeding behavior of crabeater seals is similar to that of the aardwolf, from week 23, if you are interested, read more there ;)
Suggest a new animal for this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
