Hello, friend, this is the thirtieth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter!
The 30th issue and also the first time I'm a day late ðŸ™ˆ
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday (and Tuesday)!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the badger, the bex, and in 1st place the desert rain frog!
Desert rain frogs are frogs that live in the desert! Normally, the small amphibians live near bodies of water, so wouldn't they dry out in the sand? In fact, the desert rain frog is a phenomenon among frogs. They are yellow-sand colored with large round eyes and a stocky body, about 4-6cm in size. With their short legs, they cannot jump like other frogs, but can only crawl. They are only found in Namibia and South Africa, where they bury themselves in the desert sand during the day and go hunting at night. They feed on insects and larvae, and absorb water through their skin. Since there is hardly any rain, the desert rain frogs depend on the morning fog over the dunes. Another special feature: they are born as frogs and do not go through the tadpole stage! In addition, the males make high-pitched sounds when they feel threatened or are looking for a mate. Unfortunately, desert rain frogs are threatened by diamond mines and road construction in the desert, but fortunately South Africa has established a nature reserve for them. ^^
Suggest a new animal for this week too! Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week!
Drink enough and see you next Monday (promise)!
