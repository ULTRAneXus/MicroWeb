Hello, friend, this is the thirty-first issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! A midnight edition, so to speak ;)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the hare, the turtle, and in 1st place the crocodile icefish!
Crocodile icefish inhabit the waters of the Antarctic Ocean, where they live in temperatures around the freezing point. They are gray-white, have no scales and grow up to 70cm long. They feed on krill, crustaceans and small fish. They themselves are a popular snack for the crabeater seal, which was the animal of the week 2 weeks ago. ^^ As everyone knows, blood is red. But not in the crocodile icefish! It is the only vertebrate that does not have red blood! Crocodile icefish do not have hemoglobin; this is the protein that forms iron in red blood cells, gives them their red color and binds oxygen. So how do crocodile icefish live without red blood? They transport oxygen through the blood plasma, but since this is much less efficient, they have five times as much blood as other fish! In addition, their heart pumps five times as hard, and in addition to their gills, they also absorb oxygen through their skin. However, all this is only possible in Antarctic waters, where temperatures are stable and oxygen levels are very high. Researchers are still unsure why the crocodile icefish developed in this way - the leading theory is that it was a coincidence. Thanks a lot, Darwin ;)
Suggest a new animal for this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
