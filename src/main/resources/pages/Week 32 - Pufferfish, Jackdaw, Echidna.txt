Hello, friend, here is the thirty-second issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! Another midnight edition :>
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the pufferfish, the jackdaw, and in 1st place the echidna!
Echidnas are small, cute, and spiky creatures in Australia and Oceania. They look like hedgehogs with long snouts, but are biologically hardly related to them at all and are also much larger - up to 70cm long and 15kg heavy. Echidnas can live up to 20 years and feed on ants, termites and earthworms. They use their long snout and their - up to 18cm long - sticky tongue for this. They have long spines and brown fur. Although echidnas are mammals, they do not give birth, they lay eggs! Together with the platypus, they are the only mammals to do so. The little creatures are also otherwise extraordinary. They live in all habitats, whether tropics, deserts or even mountains, where they occur at altitudes of up to 4000m; they can also swim. In case of danger, they roll up into a ball of spines or bury themselves in the ground. They have a long claw on each of their hind legs for grooming, which is very practical! In addition, echidnas are one of the few land animals that can survive forest fires, which are quite common in Australia. Curled up in burrows, even a dangerous fire can do little to harm these robust animals. Their only predators are introduced species such as the dingo or the red fox, but they are not threatened with extinction. ^^
Suggest a new animal for this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
