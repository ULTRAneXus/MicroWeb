Hello, friend, here is the thirty-second issue of my weekly friendship newsletter! :)
33, a double digit number, so it's time for mythical creatures again instead of normal animals this week!
The mythical creatures of the week are the werewolf, the sphinx, and in first place, the Wolpertinger!
The Wolpertinger is a German mythical creature in the form of a hare, often with antlers, duck wings, or duck feet. They are considered very shy, live in forests and feed on small animals and plants. Among the many German myths, this mythical creature is a relatively new one, having only emerged about 200 years ago when hunters and taxidermists in the 19th century began to mix stuffed hares with body parts of other animals to create new creatures that were sold to gullible tourists. The name "Wolpertinger" is probably derived from Walpurgis Night, the gathering of witches. Supposedly, the Wolpertinger can only be seen as a beautiful woman, and only on full moon nights in the company of a man who knows his way around the forest. Wtf. A hunter can only catch the Wolpertinger by sprinkling salt on its tail or luring it with a candle. A very peculiar creature, a tourist trap that became a German myth.
Suggest a new mythical creature for this week too! Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
