Hello, friend, this is the thirty-fifth edition of my weekly friendship newsletter! Another midnight edition :>
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to this Monday! Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the ox, the donkey, and in first place, the reindeer!
Consumer fest-uh Christmas is coming soon! So for this month there will be a few more traditional Christmas animals :) Today we start with the reindeer. Reindeer belong to the deer family, and of all deer they live furthest north, from Scandinavia and Canada to the Arctic fields around and on Greenland, where they roam the taiga and tundra of the North. Reindeer have gray-brown fur with a white underbelly and grow up to 220cm long and 140cm tall. They can live up to 20 years and reach a weight of 300kg, with their diet consisting solely of plants, grasses and lichens. A special feature of reindeer is their antlers, because female reindeer also have antlers, which is unique among deer. The antlers can grow up to 120cm long, and like fingerprints in humans, each antler is unique! In autumn and winter, many reindeer shed their antlers, often one side at a time. Reindeer live in large herds, often hundreds of thousands of animals, mostly consisting of exclusively male or female specimens. On their migrations in search of food, they travel distances of up to 5000km, more than any other mammal. They were discovered by humans as domestic animals several thousand years ago, which also explains their cultural influence, for example as the sleigh animals of Santa Claus.
Suggest a new animal for this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
