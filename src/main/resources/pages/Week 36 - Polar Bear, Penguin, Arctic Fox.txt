Hello, friend, this is the thirty-fifth edition of my weekly friendship newsletter! Another midnight edition :>
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday! Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the polar bear, the penguin, and in first place, the Arctic fox!
Arctic foxes are the northern relatives of the red fox (which I talked about in week 13) and live in the northernmost regions of the Earth, in Northern Scandinavia, Siberia, Canada, Alaska, Greenland and even on the pack ice of the Arctic Ocean. Arctic foxes grow up to 60cm long and weigh 5kg, although this doesn't include their winter fat ;) They can live up to 4 years and eat almost anything, with their main diet consisting of mice, lemmings and Arctic birds. In the food chain, polar wolves and polar bears are above them, otherwise the Arctic fox has no predators. What is particularly special about them is that Arctic foxes are the only wild dogs whose fur color changes with the seasons! In summer they have a gray-brown fur, in winter they have their distinctive snow-white - sometimes also gray-black fur (the latter is called blue fox). They have one of the densest furs of all mammals and the best insulating fur of all. Theoretically, they could survive temperatures as low as -80 degrees Celsius unharmed. They move over snow and ice with their broad, furry paws. Although their population is considered not to be endangered, Arctic foxes could become one of the biggest victims of climate change in the future. Let's hope it doesn't come to that!
Suggest a new animal for this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
