Hello, friend, this is the thirty-seventh edition of my weekly friendship newsletter! Another midnight edition :> I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the kingfisher, the lynx, and in first place, the snowy owl!
Snowy owls are the northern relatives of the eagle owl! They live in the tundra of Siberia and Canada, and also anywhere else north of the tree line. They grow up to 65cm tall, with a wingspan of up to 150cm. They weigh about 2.5kg and can live up to 10 years. They feed mainly on lemmings and other small mammals. As the name suggests, snowy owls live in the snow, but are also themselves white feathered. The males are completely white, the females with black transverse lines on their plumage. Snowy owls also have very dense feathers on their feet, which protect them from the cold but also allow them to walk on snow like snowshoes. Snowy owls are patient hunters. They often sit still for hours in a high place, as soon as they have a prey in their sights, they glide silently through the air and either kill their prey while landing or chase it over the snow. Snowy owls are at the top of the food chain, only polar foxes and predatory gulls have to be wary of them as younglings.
Suggest a new animal for this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice week! Drink enough and see you next Monday!
