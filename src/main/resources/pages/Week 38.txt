Hello, friend, this is the thirty-eighth edition of my weekly friendship newsletter! A special Christmas edition!
I hope you had an enjoyable weekend and a good start to the week!
This week, instead of the animal of the week, I wanted to share a little Christmas message. And for those who don't celebrate Christmas or don't have any big plans as well, this message is for all of you!
2024 is drawing to a close, and for me, it's been a very chaotic but not unpleasant year. I'm making progress with my studies, I haven't had much luck in gambling but I have in love, and I'm enjoying my part-time job. Of course, not all moments were pretty and I was often stressed, like probably all of us. I'd love to hear about your year! What important things happened, did you meet new people or discover new places for yourself? Were you able to achieve old goals and set new ones? Do you feel like you've made progress this year? Are you satisfied with yourself? And even if the answer to all these questions is "no" - you can still be proud of yourself! You're here and you're part of my circle of friends, which I really appreciate. I'm genuinely grateful to have you in my life, even if we don't talk that much sometimes. I hope you can enjoy the last few days of this year and that you stay healthy through the winter. No matter where you are or how you feel, I hope this message has made you a little happier. Just like all my weekly newsletters! Feel free to give me feedback on how I've been doing so far! Maybe you'd like something other than just animals every week, feel free to suggest it! I'm really looking forward to any feedback, especially from my usually silent readers ;)
Furthermore, I hope you're doing well and I wish you a wonderful week and the rest of the year! Drink plenty and see you next Monday!
