Hello, friend, this is the thirty-ninth edition of my weekly friendship newsletter! The last issue of the year!
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to this Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the ladybug, the goldfish, and in first place, the good-luck pig!
Just kidding, but pigs are actually well-known lucky charms! They are native to all continents except Antarctica, can weigh up to 350kg and be 90cm tall, depending on the species, and reach an age of up to 20 years. Pigs eat almost anything. While searching for food, they root through the ground, using their super-fine nose to find good stuff in the earth. Pigs are also very clean animals; they even use natural sunscreen in the form of mud and like to bathe often. Pigs are also highly intelligent: they can remember their names, as well as commands and simple words. Studies have found that some pigs are smarter than most dogs and can keep up with primates. Pigs can use tools and solve simple puzzles, and they are also closely related to humans, genetically speaking. Some people might not like that, but after primates, pigs have one of the highest overlap rates in terms of bone and muscle structure, brain structure, circulatory system, and so on. But why good-luck pig? Pigs were already considered lucky charms thousands of years ago, by the Germanics and Greeks. I hope they can bring you a little luck in the new year too! 2025 will be a good year for you!
