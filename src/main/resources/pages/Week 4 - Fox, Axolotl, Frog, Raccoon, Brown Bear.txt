Hello, friend, here is the fourth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
This week there is not just one Animal of the Week, but 5! I had so many great suggestions, I couldn't decide.
We have the fox, the axolotl, the frog, the raccoon and the brown bear!
Feel free to suggest a new animal this week too, maybe it will be there next time ;)
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice start into the new week! Enjoy the weather and stay healthy!
See you next Monday at the latest! :Wavey:
