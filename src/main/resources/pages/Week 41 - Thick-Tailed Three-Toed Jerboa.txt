Hello, friend, this is the forty-first edition of my weekly friendship newsletter!
I hope you had a wonderful weekend and had a great start to Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the wombat, the fire ant, and in first place, the thick-tailed three-toed jerboa!
Try saying that three times in a row! This little rodent made it to first place thanks to its cute appearance and its much too long name! This species of mice lives in the dry areas of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China. They grow up to 5cm big, with a tail that is another 10cm long, and reach an age of usually 2-3 years. Unlike other mice, these jerboas are very round and compact, with large hind legs. Their ears lie close to their body and they have brown-gold fur with a white belly. As the name suggests, their tail is unusually thick, and unlike many rodents, they also only have 3 toes. Thick-tailed three-toed jerboas, hehe, live in either temporary burrows or larger, permanent tunnels that can become quite complex. They feed on seeds and grasses as well as insects, and get most of their water intake from their food. The thick-tailed three-toed jerboa is one of 6 subspecies of three-toed jerboas, about which little is known overall, but all have much too long names. In Kazakhstan, they are featured on stamps!
Feel free to suggest a new animal for this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a wonderful week! Drink plenty and see you next Monday at the latest!
