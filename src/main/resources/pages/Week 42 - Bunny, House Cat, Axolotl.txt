Hello, friend, this is the forty-second edition of my weekly friendship newsletter! Birthday edition! That's right, I'm turning 23 today, woohoo!
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to this Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the bunny, the house cat, and in first place, the axolotl!
Axolotls are my absolute favorite animals! You often see them in white-pink, but this is more of a bred fashion color, in the wild they are brown. Axolotls are originally from Mexico, where they live only in a few freshwater lakes, making them a rather rare animal species. They can grow up to 30cm long and weigh 250g and feed on crayfish, underwater insects, and small fish. Axolotls can live up to 20 years, but they do not undergo metamorphosis throughout their lives, as would be usual with amphibians. So they remain in the larval stage their entire lives, which also explains their body structure! They have a flattened tail and the iconic gill branches on their head, with which they filter oxygen from the water. Their arms and legs are strong and short and their flat mouth is wide, their eyes are set wide apart. But axolotls can not only breathe through their gill branches, but also have and additional set of underdeveloped lungs, so they can live on land for a short time in a drought. In addition, they can also absorb oxygen through their skin. But probably the most special thing about the axolotl is its ability to regenerate everything in its body! From severed limbs to parts of the heart and even brain! Axolotls have unique stem cells that allow them to renew any part of their body. One of the many reasons I love them!
Feel free to suggest a new animal for this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a wonderful week! Drink plenty and see you next Monday!
