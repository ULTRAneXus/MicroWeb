Hello, friend, this is the forty-third edition of my weekly friendship newsletter!
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to this Monday!
Tell me about your week sometime!
The animals of the week are the earthworm, the jackdaw, and in first place, the aye-aye!
Aye-aye, Captain! But no, these are primates, not pirates! The aye-aye, also known as the finger animal (in germany, at least), belongs to the lemurs and lives in Madagascar. They grow up to 50cm long and weigh 2.7kg. They have a brown to black, rough fur, while their long tail is significantly fluffier. Aye-ayes can live over 20 years and eat almost anything, mainly insects and fruits. The aye-aye is also called a finger animal because its middle finger is much longer and thinner than all the other fingers. It looks strange but is quite practical when foraging. With it, aye-ayes can more easily get to the flesh of fruits and - similar to a woodpecker - drill into tree bark for beetle larvae. Aye-ayes are nocturnal and sleep during the day in nests in treetops, up to 15m high. They are solitary and patrol large territories, but rarely attack opponents. Aye-ayes probably got their name from the sound they make at night, which sounds somewhat similar. And there isn't a single picture where they don't look completely done with the world! xD
Feel free to suggest a new animal for this week too!
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a wonderful week! Drink plenty and see you next Monday!
