Hello, friend, here is the fifth (and quite late) issue of my weekly friendship newsletter :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start into this Monday!
This week there isn't just one Animal of the Week, again, but 3! I had so many great suggestions again, I couldn't decide.
We have the donkey, the cat (with 3 votes even!) and... Justus the proboscis monkey! Feel free to suggest a new animal this week too, I always have a blast reading the suggestions :D
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice start into the new week! Enjoy the wet weather and stay healthy!
See you next Monday at the latest!
