Hello, friend,
Here is the sixth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start into this Monday!
I have decided to turn the Animal of the Week into the Top 3 Animals of the Week, as I always get so many great submissions from you :D
This week we have the elephant, the bald eagle, and the jumping spider!
Feel free to suggest a new animal this week too, I always have a blast reading the suggestions :D
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice start into the new week! Enjoy the nice weather and stay healthy!
See you next Monday at the latest!
