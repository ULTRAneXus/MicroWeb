Hello, friend, here is the seventh issue of my weekly friendship newsletter :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Feel free to tell me about your weekend :)
The Animals of the Week are the chicken, the penguin and the cassowary!
Suggest a new animal this week too! :D
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and I wish you a nice start into the new week! Enjoy the weather and stay healthy! See you next Monday at the latest! :C3POWave:
