Hello, friend, here is the eighth issue of my weekly friendship newsletter :)
I hope you had a nice weekend and had a good start to Monday!
Tell me about your week!
The animals of the week are the beaver, the mantis shrimp and the red panda!
Feel free to suggest a new animal this week too! :D
Furthermore, I hope you are doing well and wish you a nice start into the new week! Enjoy the weather and stay healthy! Drink enough :)
See you next Monday, already in June then! :redpandawave:
